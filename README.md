# Sensor-Monitor
This program works with a open source program called OpenHardwareMonitor (OHP).
Taking advantage of the server that OHP can create a WebCrawler visits the site
and, writes the data to a file. For me I write the data to a flash drive so if the
computer crashes I have access to the data. To avoid ending up with hundreds of files,
the files are continuously deleted leaving only 4 files in existence.
